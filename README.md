So you've found Project Aventure.
This project is still underway and is being updated all the time.
The idea for this project is that your choices matter.  What you do could effect the outcome.
I plan to make this game about an 1 hour to 1 hour and 45 minutes.
If I like the direction of this game I could make it episodic or even give it a sequal.
So stay tuned for more updates and features.


Currectly in the game...

A name system featuring your own name and 1 of 18 random names.
A gender system which effects dialogue and the name of your spouse.
A choice system where choices can effect the future of the game.
Currently 1 major choice in the game.
About 7-10 minutes of dialogue.
And a bunch of bugs that will be ironed out in future versions.
